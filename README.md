### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Johnson, well - I have different names, some call me 'Yimika. Officially, I am Babajide Johnson Odejide. Anyways, I prefer ***Oluwayimika*** but if that's difficult to pronounce, just call me Johnson ðŸ˜„ 

I am a multilingual software systems analyst now turning statistical sleuth (Data Scientist) with a concentration on Business Analytics.

Generally speaking, 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring how to draw meaningful inferences from data using tools such as R and Python. Exploring, cleaning, manipulating, describing, summarizing, visualizing and analyzing data mostly using R.

- I am a "Jack of many trades" but I don't claim to be master of any. I simply love to critique software systems!

- (thinking...) I love asking meaningful(less) questions. Jokes apart, I love doing research! I love asking questions like - "Why?", "What if?".

- I also love to follow standards, not all the time though because it takes time to learn the standards of everything but it's part of my goals. 

- My ultimate ambition is to be pleasing to God and to do my work as though it is unto the Lord!

Having said all that, you may continue to explore and if you wish to know more about me, please feel free to reach out.
